    "In this lab, we will be creating a three-color (or RGB) image of the Andromeda galaxy.  The lab is separated into three sections.  In the first section, we will familiarize ourselves with the code and produce an initial image.  In the second section, we will be editing the image's color as well as examining how the color is applied.  In the third section, we will make a final image of the galaxy (including any edits made), which will then be printed off to take home.  \n",

    "**function** → a piece of code written to carry out a specific task in the program.  For example:  print(‘Hello world’) is a function that will print out the words “Hello world” when you run the program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**module** → libraries of functions, which you import into Python in order to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**comment** → a line of code with a ‘#’ in front.  This line will be skipped by the program and not run as part of the code.  Comments are good for commentary on various sections of the code (hence the name), as well as to temporarily prevent a section of the code from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "**string** → a section of code inside quotations:  “Hello world” and ‘Hello world’ are both strings.  Usually used for filenames, as well as certain variables and parameters.  \n",

Viewed without a color filter, they will be in black and white.  To make a color image of Andromeda, we map each filter (wavelength) to a color—blue, green, or red.  We then define how vivid to make that color, as well as how to define the color gradient for each filter.\n",
